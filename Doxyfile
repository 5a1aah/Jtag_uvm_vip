EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS       = NO

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 100

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents

# of tag files.

# Configuration options related to the dot tool

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate a class diagram

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = YES

# You can include diagrams made with dia in doxygen documentation. Doxygen will

DOT_NUM_THREADS        = 0

# When you want a differently looking font in the dot files that doxygen
